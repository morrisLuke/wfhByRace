<p>Let’s take a look at who reported to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs">U.S. Census Bureau’s 2021 1-year American Community Survey</a> that they work from home. We’ll see which areas of LA County have the most freedom to work from home, and we’ll explore how race and ethnicity play into who reported the ability to work from home across different parts of the county.</p>
